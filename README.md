# Quantumm transport simulations in graphene.

In this repository you can find electronic quantumm transport in graphene using kwant for my bachelor's thesis using python and more specifically kwant.

Files so far are:

* GNR ARMCHAIR con vacantes.ipynb : Code for quantumm transport in armchair graphene nanoribbons (w and w/o vacants).
* GrapheneNR(ZZ).ipynb            : Code for quantumm transport in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (w and w/o vacants).

Files are in format ipynb so JupyterNotebook (https://jupyter.org/); also, libraries Numpy (https://numpy.org/) Kwant (https://kwant-project.org/) and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) are needed.
Anaconda distribution is recomended (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which already has pre-installed those libraries.


I also have a cocalc (https://cocalc.com/app) project for those who do not want to download those libraries or use JupyterNotebook, if you want to join just send me an e-mail to iriansan@ucm.es asking for it.
