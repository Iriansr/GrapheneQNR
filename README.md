# Quantumm transport simulations in graphene.

In this repository you can find electronic quantumm transport in graphene using kwant for my bachelor's thesis using python and more specifically kwant.

Files so far are:

* GrapheneNR AC.ipynb  : Code for quantumm transport in armchair graphene nanoribbons (w and w/o vacants).
* GrapheneNR(ZZ).ipynb : Code for quantumm transport in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (w and w/o vacants).
* ac-functionalstudy.ipynb : Code for testing dependance between vacancies and conductance in ACGNR.
* zz-functionalstudy.ipynb : Code for testing dependance between vacancies and conductance in ZZGNR.


Files are in format ipynb so JupyterNotebook (https://jupyter.org/); also, libraries Numpy (https://numpy.org/) Kwant (https://kwant-project.org/) and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) are needed. For ac/zz-fucntionalstudy.ipynb Pandas, CSV and OS need to be also included.
Anaconda distribution is recomended (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which already has pre-installed those libraries.

Both testing notebooks have acces to a file in google colab if you do not want to download anaconda/install the required libraries..
